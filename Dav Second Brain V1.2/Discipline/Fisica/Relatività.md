[[Einstein]]: "Light must bend in a gravitational field", but light also always takes the shortest path, maybe the shortest path under gravity is not a straight line. Gravity thus must bend space. Thanks to [[Marcel Grossman]] he then proved the theory with the math needed. Newton thought that space and time were fixed. 
[[John Wheeler]]: "Space-time tells the matter how to move. Matter tells space-time how to curve."
This theory proved itself practical by anticipating Mercury's ellipse, which was a mistery.
__Gravity bends space__.
# Time
Light also moves at the same constant speed, no matter the referencing frame. Speed is $$\frac{distance}{time}$$ But we already said that light always has the same speed, so the speed of light near gravity and the speed of light in empty space is the same. But the lenght traveled by light near gravity is greater then the one in empty space, this means that the time it takes must pass slower near the gravitational field. 
__Gravity slows time down__.
# Ricapitolando
La misura propria è la più lunga: $$L=\frac{L_0}{\gamma}$$
Dove: $$\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{V²}{C²}}}$$
