# Variety of Visuals
Do not minimaze shot duration just for the sake of it
Add movement to clips
Add captions for making the viewer understand the point
Highlight the important area in the clip
Use color for changing the connotation of the words
Make the video look good
# Visual Continuity
No rough edges
No points for distractions
Use sound effects for merging visuals
Keep the focus of the new clip near the one of the older clip between cuts
Break visual continuity for getting viewer attention
# Immersive Audio
Use audio to influence viewer emotion/point of view
